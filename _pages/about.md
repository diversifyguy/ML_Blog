# Misc
I love using YouTube as a learning tool and believe it is the biggest human revolution since the Gutenberg printing press. 
I similarly love using Twitter as a learning tool. I try and avoid politics & pop culture and just focus on content that will level-up my knowledge and skills.
I've collated my basketball coaching portfolio and published it at (jjhoffstein.github.io)[https://jjhoffstein.github.io]
I have a photic sneeze reflex, which means that I sneeze basically every time I walk outside and look at the sun.
