My hope is that blogging will help clarify my thoughts, sharpen my ideas, and elicit feedback from others. Thank you for your participation in this process! . As a blogger, my goal is to heed Professor James Miller&#39;s three pieces of writing advice: be clear, be concise, and be interesting -- in that order of importance. . twitter: https://twitter.com/JimDMiller/status/1376642170694860805?s=20 . So without further ado, please wish me luck on this journey, and feel free to DM me anytime on Twitter @jjhoffstein. Thank you!! .",
