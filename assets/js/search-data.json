Well rehearsed and comically repetitive, interviews with professional athletes lead to more eye rolling than genuine interest among even the most devoted fans. However, if studied with the right approach on a sufficiently large dataset, we may be able to extract some interesting insights from these contractually obligated rituals. . We’ll use Beautiful Soup and HTML tagging to gather and organize data, open source (and one designed by yours truly) text classification methods, and matplotlib to showcase the results. . We gather data from ASAP Sports, a website that provides athlete interview transcripts to journalists. We use practice day interviews with players and coaches during the Stanley Cup Finals, starting with the year 1997 and ending with 2019. Mathieu Bray’s comparison¹ of coaches Mike Sullivan and Peter DeBoer inspired much of this blog post, most notably the use of ASAP Sports. . Web Scraping .

Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t really work, and I&#39;m not sure why! My suspicion is that it&#39;s due to overfitting, which is something I&#39;ll learn about more later. .
