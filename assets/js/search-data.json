I&#39;ve gotten interested in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, and now here I am blogging about it. My hope is that blogging will help clarify my thoughts, sharpen my ideas, and elicit feedback from others. . To that end, my goal is to remain faithful to Professor James Miller&#39;s three pieces of writing advice: be clear, be concise, be interesting -- in that order of importance. . twitter: https://twitter.com/JimDMiller/status/1376642170694860805?s=20 .",
